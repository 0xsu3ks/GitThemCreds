# GitThemCreds

## Public version of GitThemCreds tool

This is a public version of a tool I created to help with external reconnasiance on GitHub. This tool lacks many of the features that I am currently using in my private version which I plan to release once it's perfect.

For now here is the barebones script that makes a simple API call to the GitHub API. What's not here is:
  + Pagination
  + Rate limiting Checks
  + Output files
  + Secrets scanning
  + Report ready outputs
  + Organization searching
  + Sorting unique URLs 
  + and a bunch more

GitHub API is a pain in the neck to work with so best of luck adding some cool features. In the meantime use this as a skeleton to make your own GOAT GitHub Secret Scanner
